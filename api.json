      "full": "The Mystery Airships represent one of the most significant mass sighting events in pre-modern aviation history. Beginning in November 1896 in California, reports of large cigar-shaped craft with bright searchlights and visible propellers spread across the nation through April 1897. Witnesses described occupied vehicles piloted by human-like figures, often claiming the operators were secret inventors. This occurred during a time when dirigible technology was experimental and the Wright Brothers' first flight would not occur until **1903** — six years after the wave ended — making the reported technology seemingly impossible. The wave generated extensive newspaper coverage, thousands of witness reports, and remains a cornerstone case in early UFO research. Modern analysis suggests a combination of hoaxes, misidentifications, and mass hysteria, though the cultural impact and historical significance remain substantial."
