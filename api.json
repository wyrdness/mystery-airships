      "summary": "A wave of mysterious airship sightings across the United States from November 1896 through April 1897, predating the Wright Brothers' first flight by six years. Thousands witnessed cigar-shaped craft with searchlights and propellers, reportedly occupied by human-like pilots.",
      "full": "The Mystery Airships represent one of the most significant mass sighting events in pre-modern aviation history. Beginning in November 1896 in California, reports of large cigar-shaped craft with bright searchlights and visible propellers spread across the nation through April 1897. Witnesses described occupied vehicles piloted by human-like figures, often claiming the operators were secret inventors. This occurred during a time when dirigible technology was experimental and the Wright Brothers' first flight would not occur until 1903, making the reported technology seemingly impossible. The wave generated extensive newspaper coverage, thousands of witness reports, and remains a cornerstone case in early UFO research. Modern analysis suggests a combination of hoaxes, misidentifications, and mass hysteria, though the cultural impact and historical significance remain substantial."
